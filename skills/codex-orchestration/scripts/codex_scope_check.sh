# codex_scope_check.sh — mechanically verify that a run stayed inside its
# declared file scope.
#
# The orchestrator's instruction "do not add features not in this packet" is a
# text-level request. This script is the executable gate behind it: it diffs the
# worktree against the pre-run commit and fails if any changed file falls
# outside the task's allowlist.
#
# It is author-agnostic on purpose. It checks what the working tree looks like,
# not who edited it — so it catches the orchestrator quietly fixing production
# code just as well as it catches Codex wandering out of scope.
#
# Orchestration metadata (the plan directory, run artifacts) is excluded: it is
# written by the orchestrator throughout the loop and is not product. Codex is
# kept out of it by the fingerprint check in codex_run.sh, not by this gate.
#
# Usage:
#   codex_scope_check.sh <allowlist_file> <workdir> [base_ref]
#
# Args:
#   allowlist_file  One glob per line. Blank lines and `#` comments ignored.
#                   Pass the FROZEN copy under <rundir>/allowlist, not the
#                   plan's live file — see codex_run.sh.
#   workdir         Git repository to inspect.
#   base_ref        Commit to diff against. Default: HEAD. Pass the empty
#                   string only for a repository with no commits yet.
#
# Patterns are matched with bash `[[ str == glob ]]`, where `*` also matches
# `/`. So `src/*` covers the whole `src` subtree, and `*.py` covers every Python
# file in the repo. Anchor a pattern by writing the full path.
#
# Renames are checked on both sides. `git diff --name-only` reports only the
# destination of a rename, which would let `git mv out-of-scope/x.py allowed/y.py`
# delete an out-of-scope file invisibly; --name-status exposes both paths and
# both must be allowed.
#
# Exit codes:
#   0  every changed file is covered by the allowlist
#   1  at least one changed file is outside it
#   2  usage / environment error
