# codex_run.sh — hand an implementation task to OpenAI Codex (headless).
#
# Claude Code (the orchestrator) writes an instruction file, then calls this
# script. Codex does the code investigation / design / implementation / tests
# and writes back a report. Nothing here is Claude-specific: it is a thin,
# auditable wrapper around `codex exec`.
#
# Usage:
#   codex_run.sh <instruction_file> <workdir> [rundir]
#
# Args:
#   instruction_file  Markdown/plain-text task packet written by Claude.
#   workdir           Repository/directory Codex is allowed to modify.
#   rundir            Where to store this task's artifacts. Default: a
#                     timestamped directory under <workdir>/.codex-runs/.
#
# Layout — every attempt gets its own directory, so the hint loop never
# overwrites the evidence from the attempt it is trying to fix:
#
#   <rundir>/attempt-1/report.md      Codex's final message == its result report
#   <rundir>/attempt-1/events.jsonl   full JSONL event stream
#   <rundir>/attempt-1/stderr.log     standard error
#   <rundir>/attempt-1/meta.json      run metadata (exit code, paths, commit)
#   <rundir>/attempt-1/scope.txt      allowlist verdict, when one applies
#   <rundir>/base_commit              pre-run commit; the scope-check baseline
#   <rundir>/task.md                  ┐ the frozen contract — the gates read
#   <rundir>/allowlist                ├ THESE, never the plan's live files
#   <rundir>/test                     ┘
#   <rundir>/plan_dir                 which plan this run belongs to
#   <rundir>/thread_id                session id for a targeted resume
#
# `codex_resume.sh` adds attempt-2, attempt-3, ... to the same <rundir>.
#
# Env overrides (all optional):
#   CODEX_MODEL       -> passed as `-m` (e.g. o4-mini, gpt-5-codex).
#   CODEX_SANDBOX     -> `--sandbox` value: read-only | workspace-write |
#                        danger-full-access. Default: workspace-write.
#   CODEX_EXTRA_ARGS  -> extra raw args appended to `codex exec`.
#   CODEX_ALLOWLIST   -> path to the file-scope allowlist. Default: the
#                        instruction file with .md replaced by .allowlist,
#                        when that file exists.
#   CODEX_INTERFACES  -> contracts file injected into the prompt. Default:
#                        interfaces.md beside the instruction file. Set to the
#                        empty string to inject nothing.
#   CODEX_TIMEOUT     -> seconds before Codex is killed. Default 3600, 0 = off.
#   CODEX_META_DIR    -> orchestration metadata, workdir-relative.
#                        Default .codex-instructions.
#   CODEX_ALLOW_DIRTY=1           -> skip the uncommitted-changes preflight.
#   CODEX_ALLOW_DEFAULT_BRANCH=1  -> allow running on the default branch.
#
# Exit codes:
#   0   Codex succeeded and stayed inside the allowlist
#   2   usage / preflight error (Codex was never started)
#   3   Codex succeeded but changed files outside the allowlist
#   4   Codex modified orchestration metadata (it must never do this)
#   *   otherwise, Codex's own exit code
#
# NOTE ON CODEX CLI FLAGS: `codex exec` is non-interactive, so there is no
# approval prompt; what Codex may read/write/run is governed entirely by
# `--sandbox`. This wrapper needs four things from the CLI: a prompt, a working
# directory, a sandbox level, and a way to capture the final message + JSON.
# Flags verified against codex-cli 0.144.6 — if your installed version's
# `codex exec --help` disagrees, adjust the flags below to match.
